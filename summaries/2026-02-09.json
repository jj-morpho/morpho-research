  "summary_markdown": "## 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis week saw 7 integrator calls focused heavily on vault configuration questions, liquidation parameter tuning, and oracle integration patterns. Several integrators expressed confusion around the relationship between LLTV and liquidation incentives, suggesting a documentation gap that the marketing team could address.\n\n## 2. Main Themes\n\n- **Vault configuration & parameter selection** — Came up in 5 out of 7 calls. Integrators building custom vaults are unsure how to select optimal LLTV, oracle sources, and fee structures. Mentioned by: Steakhouse, Gauntlet, KPK Finance.\n- **Oracle integration patterns** — 4 mentions. Teams want clarity on which oracle setups are battle-tested vs. experimental. Chainlink vs. custom feeds was a recurring topic. Mentioned by: Avantgarde, Vault Bridge.\n- **Risk management tooling** — 3 mentions. Integrators want better programmatic access to risk metrics — real-time collateral ratios, liquidation proximity alerts. Mentioned by: Gauntlet, KPK Finance, Steakhouse.\n- **Cross-chain expansion** — 2 mentions. Questions about Morpho's Base and Arbitrum roadmap. Integrators want to plan multi-chain strategies. Mentioned by: Vault Bridge, a new prospective integrator.\n\n## 3. Misunderstandings & Friction Points\n\n- **LLTV vs. liquidation incentive confusion** — Multiple integrators conflated the Liquidation Loan-to-Value ratio with the liquidation bonus/incentive. In one call, an integrator set their LLTV assuming it was the threshold at which liquidators get rewarded, when in fact it's the threshold at which positions *become* liquidatable. The correct understanding: LLTV is the ceiling; the liquidation incentive is a separate parameter that determines profitability for liquidators.\n- **Shared liquidity misconception** — Two integrators assumed that Morpho vaults share liquidity like Aave pools. They were surprised to learn that each Morpho market is isolated, and vaults are curators that allocate across isolated markets. This is a fundamental architectural distinction worth a dedicated explainer.\n- **Fee accrual timing** — One integrator expected fees to compound in real-time but discovered they accrue per-interaction (on supply, withdraw, etc.). This led to confusion in their yield projections.\n\n## 4. Questions Integrators Are Asking\n\n**Vault Setup:**\n- \"What LLTV should we use for a wstETH/USDC market?\"\n- \"Can we change parameters after vault deployment?\"\n- \"How do we set up a multi-collateral vault?\"\n\n**Oracles:**\n- \"Which oracle should we use for LST-based collateral?\"\n- \"What happens if the oracle goes stale?\"\n\n**Risk:**\n- \"How do we monitor our vault's health in real-time?\"\n- \"Is there an API for liquidation event data?\"\n\n## 5. Feature Requests & Pain Points\n\n- **Vault parameter simulation tool** — Integrators want a sandbox to model how different LLTV/fee/oracle configs affect vault performance before deploying on-chain.\n- **Better vault analytics dashboard** — Several teams are building their own monitoring; a shared dashboard would save effort.\n- **Multi-collateral vault support** — Integrators building diversified strategies want a single vault that can handle multiple collateral types without needing separate markets.\n- **Webhook/alert system** — Teams want to be notified when positions approach liquidation thresholds.\n\n## 6. Content Ideas for This Week\n\n- **Blog post: \"LLTV Explained: The Most Misunderstood Parameter in DeFi Lending\"** — Addresses the LLTV/liquidation incentive confusion directly. High educational value, likely to be shared. Addresses friction point #1.\n- **Tweet thread: \"Morpho vs. Aave Architecture: Why Isolated Markets Matter\"** — Clarifies the shared-liquidity misconception with visual diagrams. Addresses friction point #2.\n- **Documentation page: \"Oracle Selection Guide for Vault Curators\"** — Practical decision tree for choosing oracles based on collateral type. Addresses theme #2 and integrator questions.\n- **Short video: \"Setting Up Your First Morpho Vault in 5 Minutes\"** — Walkthrough aimed at new integrators, covering the parameters that trip people up. Addresses theme #1.\n- **Blog post: \"What Integrators Are Building on Morpho (February 2026)\"** — Showcase the variety of strategies being built, without revealing confidential details. Builds community excitement.\n- **Documentation page: \"Vault Parameter Reference\"** — Comprehensive reference with recommended ranges for each parameter, FAQ from real integrator questions.\n\n## 7. Notable Quotes\n\n> \"We spent two weeks building a monitoring dashboard that we thought Morpho would provide out of the box.\" — Gauntlet team member\n\n> \"The isolated market model is actually better for us once we understood it — we just wish the docs made that clearer upfront.\" — Vault Bridge\n\n> \"We need to be able to simulate parameter changes before we go live. Right now it's trial and error.\" — KPK Finance\n\n> \"Our users keep asking why the APY fluctuates so much — we need better tooling to explain the rate model.\" — Steakhouse\n\n> \"Cross-chain is make or break for our strategy. If Morpho isn't on Base by Q2, we'll have to look elsewhere.\" — Prospective integrator",
